## Cygwin
On windows I use the cygwin environemnt. Cygwin is a collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows. To install it go to https://www.cygwin.com and follow the installation steps. The installer is a graphical package manager that enable the instalation of a selection of packages from a big repository of packages. Make sure to install the following:
 * gcc
 * make
 * git
 * gitk (still have issues on this one)
 * vim (if this is your editor)
